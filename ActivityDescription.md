# Summer Research Project Activity Description

## Objective

The Summer Research Project 2022 is designed to expose research to undergraduate students during their early year of study.

## Extent of Participation

As stated in the "Project Schedule", this program is expected to last for 13 weeks and take around 400 hours in total.

During the first month, I am planning to complete a series of online webinars ([CS224N 2019 Winter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)) to gain an overall view of Natural Language Processing, as well as to implement a few fundamental models to aid deeper understanding. In the following month, I am considering reading on several recent papers of my interest on NLP to understand what are the prevalent approaches to address different sorts of issues and how their progress are. While reading, I will also be trying to implement a few of them and find an interested direction to pursue further. In the last month, I am considering about diving deeper into the field I have picked and experimenting with different models to gain deeper insights. I will also be writing a final report and its content is either a literature review or a real report depending on how my progress is in the direction I have chosen.

## Expected Benefits

During this project, I hope to gain more insights into the trending Natural Language Processing area. I hope to understand what the most pressing issues are in this fields as well as what are the current solutions. I also hope to gain.

With this project, I hope to be benefited from following manners:

1. Gain basic research skills: to read papers, to formulate problems and analyze on such problems;
2. Gain deeper insights into the trending Natural Language Processing: understand the current accomplishments, the most pressing issues and the current measures to address such issues;
3. Link the basic math knowledge (Calculus, Linear Algebra and Statistics) with more advanced areas and have a more advanced understanding
