# Week3 Report

Week3: *23 May - 29 May*

## Learning Progress

- [x] Complete ALL lectures in CS224N
- [ ] Look for a possible direction to focus on

## Learning Outcome

- learn about the **Natural Language Generation** task:
  - relevant *decoding algorithms (greedy, beam search, sampling-based)*
  - measuring metric: *human evaluation, ROUGE, perplexity* and their limitations
  - various challenges in different NLG tasks
- learn about the **coreference resolution** problem and its linkage to many other NLP problems:
  - Hobb's algorithm, Mention Pair, Mention Ranking, and Cluster-based
- learn about **multitask learning** in order to reduce repeated work in pre-training:
  - to convert a list of different NLP tasks into the form of **Question Answering**;
  - different *training strategies*: curriculum learning and anti-curriculum learning;
- read briefly on **constituency parsing** and understand its role in syntactic analysis;
- learn about how *safety, bias and fairness* can be tackled in the machine learning tasks:
  - different biases in life and in the dataset
  - introduce sensitive attribute as an additional *negative gradient* to negate the effect of the undesired attribute in **Adversarial Learning**
- read a survey on *extractive summary* and self-search on unfamiliar terms
- discuss possible future directions with @Xincheng

## Current Problem

Despite the content covered in CS224N has been fully studied by now, I have yet to decide which direction to dive deeper into and also to formulate the problem clearly based on a context that is both novel and practical. I am also running short of time to implement any model covered in lectures as wished last week and will try starting to implement BERT basic during my spare time this week.

## Goal for Next Week

- [ ] read surveys on Neural Machine Translation
- [ ] make a preliminary plan for direction to work on
- [ ] implement BERT basic model during spare time
