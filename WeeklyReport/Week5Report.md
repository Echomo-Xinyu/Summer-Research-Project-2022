# Week5 Report

Week5: *6 June - 12 June*

## Learning Progress

- [x] read survey on Question Answering over Knowledge Base (KBQA)
- [x] discuss distinct line between Information Retrieval based methods (IR) and Neural Semantic Parser based methods (NSP)
- [x] make roadmap for Neural Semantic Parser for KBQA

## Learning Outcome

In the survey on Question Answering, I have:

- understood the problem of Question Answering and current limitations -- how the SOTA models are still restricted and underperforming on certain *complex* tasks
- had general background knowledge about commonly used Knowledge Base and relevant datasets
- had clear idea about cut-line between IR and NSP: IR ranks candidate answers based on their representations against questions whereas NSP aims to better convert natural language questions to executable query language
- understood how *Feature Engineering* and *Representation Learning* can be used in IR-based methods
- had clear idea on the development journey in Query Graph and Encode-decoder approach in NSP approach

## Goals for Next Week

- [ ] read the new survey on Constrained Question Answering over Knowledge Base during free time when travelling
